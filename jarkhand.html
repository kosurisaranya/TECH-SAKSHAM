<img src="hazard2.jpg">
<p><i>For preservation of the fauna and to enable visitors to view wild animals in their state of freedom a national park has been constituted within the Hazaribag district. It starts from about 10 miles from Hazaribag town on the Hazaribag-Barhi road and extends to east and west, but mostly westward for several miles. The total area is about 150 square miles with a core of right-free forest covering 80 square miles. Shooting is strictly prohibited in the entire 150 square miles, but while the inner core of 80 square miles has been preserved in the state of nature and no cutting of trees or disturbance of the flora in any manner is permitted, in the outer fringe of 70 square miles normal exploration has been allowed. A number of watchtowers to view the forest and wild life have been constructed and a Forest Rest House built at Rajderwah, 18 miles, from Hazaribag.</i></p>

<img src="parasanth.jpg">
<p><i>Parasnath Hills are a range of hills located in Giridih district of Jharkhand. The highest peak is 1350 metres. It is one of the most important pilgrimage centre for Jains. They call it Sammed Sikhar. The hill is named after Parasnath, the 23rd Tirthankara. Twenty of Jain Tirthankaras attained salvation on this hill. For each of them there is a shrine (gumti or tuk) on the hill. Some of the temples on the hill are believed to be more than 2,000 years old. However, although the place is habited from ancient times, the temples may be of more recent origin. The Santhals call it Marang Buru, the hill of the deity. They celebrate a hunting festival on the full moon day in Baisakh</i></p>

<h1 ><b>DEOGHAR</b></h1>
<img src="deoghar.jpg">
<p><i>Deoghar is a Hindi word and the literal meaning of ‘Deoghar’ is abode (‘ghar’) of the Gods and Goddesses (‘dev’). Deoghar is also known as “Baidyanath Dham”, “Baba Dham”, “B. Deoghar”. The origin of Baidyanathdham is lost in antiquity. It has been referred to as Haritakivan or Ketakivan in Sanskrit Texts. The name Deoghar seems to be of recent origin and probably dates from the erection of the great temple of Lord Baidyanath. Although the name of the builder of the temple is not traceable, certain parts of the front portion of the temple are said to have been built by Puran Mal, an ancestor of the Maharaja of Giddhour, in 1596.Deoghar district is one of the twenty-four districts of Jharkhand state in eastern India, and Deoghar town is the administrative headquarters of this district. This district is known for the Baidyanath Jyotirlinga shrine. This district is part of Santhal Pargana division.Deoghar district is located in the western portion of Santhal paraganas. It is bounded by Bhagalpur district in north, Dumka in south-east and Giridih in west.</i></p>

<p><i>The best place to visit in Hazaribagh. Around 2019 feet above sea level, Canary (Kanhari) Hill is about 5 km from town. It has a well-laid out park and is studded with three small lakes. It also has an observation tower (you will have to climb around 600 stairs) and a guest house too, which is reachable by road. From the top of the hill one can have a panoramic view of the town, especially the sunrise and sunset.

in the 80's Wolves, Tigers, Hyenas used to prawl in this place... but now they are only in paper.. some years back some Hyenas were reportedly seen in the Jungle surrounding this place.</i></p>
