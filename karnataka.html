<img src="keshava 2.jpg">
<p><i>The Chennakesava Temple, also referred to as Chennakeshava Temple and Keshava Temple, is a Vaishnava Hindu temple on the banks of River Kaveri at Somanathapura, Karnataka, India. The temple was consecrated in 1258 CE by Somanatha Dandanayaka, a general of the Hoysala King Narasimha III. It is located 38 kilometres (24 mi) east of Mysuru city.The Chennakesava temple, states George Michell, represents the climax of the development in Hoysala temple style and yet is also unique in many ways</i></p>

<h1 ><b>COORG HILLS</b></h1>

<p><i>Having peace of intellectual and youth of spirituality, this place is ready to offer whatever it possesses by the grace of God and divine Nature. The dense forests covered with dew of early morning which mist has left behind as a tell-tale sign of her presence, coffee plantations on steep slopes, falling and flowing Cauvery River from a distant place refreshing and nurturing the flora and fauna and its harsh yet soothing noise, a golden yellow-orange ritually spread on the sheet of morning sky acting as backdrop to the contrasting green-brown small-big peaks, and many such vivid sceneries of Nature are a constant companion of those choosing to travel Coorg.

Hear the name Kodaimalenadu and it rarely strikes of Kodagu in Karnataka, if knowledge of places is limited. Coorg is the name with which masses remember this hill beauty of south which is nothing but the anglicized version of the local name of the place- Kodagu.</i></p>

<h1 ><b>MYSORE PALACE</b></h1>

<p><i>The Palace of Mysore (also known as the Amba Vilas Palace) is a historical palace in the city of Mysore in Karnataka. Designed by the English Architect, Henry Irwin, the Mysore Palace dominates the skyline of Mysore. A three storied structure in the Indo-Saracenic style built between 1897-1912, the palace has beautifully designed square towers at cardinal points, covered with domes. The Durbar Hall with its ornate ceiling and sculpted pillars and the Kalyanamantapa (marriage pavilion) with its glazed tiled flooring and stained glass, domed ceiling are worth noting.Intricately carved doors, the golden howdah (elephant seat), paintings as well as the fabulous, jewel encrusted golden throne (displayed during Dasara) are amongst the palace’s other treasures. The walled palace complex houses the Residential Museum (incorporating some of the Palace’s living quarters), temples and shrines including the Shwetha Varahaswamy temple. The palace is illuminated on Sundays, Public Holidays as well as during the Dasara Celebrations where 97,000 electric bulbs are used to illuminate it.</i></p>

<p><i>Gol Gumbaz is the most famous monument in Vijayapura. It is the tomb of Mohammed Adil Shah (ruled 1627–1657). It is the second largest dome ever built, next in size only to St Peter’s Basilica in Rome. A particular attraction in this monument is the central chamber, where every sound is echoed seven times. Another attraction at the Gol Gumbaz is the Whispering Gallery, where even minute sounds can be hear clearly 37 metres away. Gol Gumbaz complex includes a mosque, a Naqqar Khana (a hall for the trumpeters) (now it is used as museum) and the ruins of guest houses. Its vast dome is said to be the Second Largest Dome, unsupported by pillars, in the world, after St. Peter’s in the Vatican City of Rome.It is constructed in such a way that even a pin drop can be heard distinctly from across a space of 38 m, in the Whispering Gallery. The acoustics here are such that any sound made is said to be repeated 10 times over. In the surrounding ornamental gardens is an archeological museum.</i></p>
