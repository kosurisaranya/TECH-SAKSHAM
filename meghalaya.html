There are some places inside the cave where you will need to squeeze around and crawl – and this adds to the experience of cave exploration. The Mawsmai cave route that is accessible to tourists is not very long and is very safe so you do not want to miss out on this unique opportunity. The cave is also famous for its fossils, some which you can spot if you spend some time peering at the walls and formations inside.</i></p>

<p><i>The Elephant Falls are a two-tier waterfall in Shillong, Meghalaya, India. The mountain stream descends through two successive falls set in dells of fern-covered rocks.The first fall of Elephant Falls is an example of a horsetail-punchbowl waterfall. The first fall is very broad and is hidden among trees. The second fall however, is quite domesticated and in the winters (and drier months) looks inconsequential. The third fall is the tallest and comes to view suddenly and looks most spectacular with crystal clear water falling over sharp rocks of myriad shapes.</i></p>
