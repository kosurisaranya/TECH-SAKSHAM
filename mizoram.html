<p><i>The Durtlang hills are located to the north of Aizawl and the way to the hill top is extremely fascinating as it offers great scenery along a steep slope. There are private cars and buses available to take passengers up to the hills from Aizawl.

The view from the top of the Durtlang hills is absolutely breathtaking as it gives an overall view of the dramatic countryside complemented with a pleasant weather. The view is never the same at any instant and keeps changing throughout the day. The glorious morning and the colourful evenings are both equally enjoyable.</i></p>
