<h1 ><b>GOLDEN TEMPLE</b></h1>
<img src="golden temple.jpg">
<p><i> Golden Temple, or Golden Gurudwara is the holiest shrine of Sikhs. It was built in late 16th century by Sri Guru Arjan Dev ji , and a copy of the Sikh scripture was placed inside the Gurudwara in 1604. Its sanctum walls were covered in marble and the dome was decorated with gold foil by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in the 19th century.[2] More than 100,000 people visit this monument every month

Sackhkhand Sri Harmandir Sahib is the official and original name of the Golden Temple.[1] It is in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India. The Gurudwara is surrounded by a sacred pool called "sarover"and group of buildings important to the Sikh religion. The complex is the most important pilgrimage site in Sikhism and it is also called Sri Darbar Sahib. One of these buildings in the complex is the Sri Akal Takht, the highest religious authority for Khalsa Sikhs. Another building is the langar, where a free simple vegetarian meal is served to all without any discrimination. The Gurudwara is a place of worship for men and women from all walks of life and all religions to come and worship God. The four entrances (representing the four directions) to get into the Harmandir Sahib also symbolise the openness of the Sikhs towards all people and religions.[3]

The present-day gurdwara was rebuilt in 1764 by Jassa Singh Ahluwalia with the help of other Sikh Misls. In the early nineteenth century, Maharaja Ranjit Singh founded the Sikh Empire and covered the upper floors of the gurdwara with gold, which gives it its distinctive appearance and its English name.[10] It contains the Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji, the Sikh scripture. On 4th July 1955, Indian Army entered the complex wearing shoes and caused destruction in the complex. Also, in June 1984 the Golden Temple complex was blown apart by tanks, snipers, grenades and rocket launchers by the Indian military and government and Sri Akal Takht Sahib was destroyed and then rebuilt later. It was once again attacked at a smaller scale by the Punjab Police, National Security Guard and Border Security Force in 1986 as part of Operation Black Thunder 1 from April-July 1986 and Operation Black Thunder 2 in May 1988. </i></p>

<h1 ><b>AKAL TAKHT</b></h1>
<img src="akalthakti.jpg">
<p><i>Akal Takhat means the Throne of the Immortal and is the highest political institution of the Sikhs. Akal means “The Timeless One” – another term for God. Takhat means “throne” in Persian.

The Sri Akal Takhat is an impressive building that sits directly in front of the causeway leading to the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Punjab, India. The Sri Akal Takhat was founded by Sri Guru Hargobind Ji on June 15, 1606 (now celebrated on 2 July) and was established as the place from which the spiritual and temporal concerns of the Sikh community could be acted upon.

It stood as a symbol of political bulwark against the Mughal Emperors in the 17th and 18th century. Various attacks on the Sri Akal Takhat and Sri Harimandir Sahib have been led in past by Ahmed Shah Abdali and Massa Rangar in the 18th century.

On June 4, 1984, the Indian Army did more than just damage to the outer facade of the Sri Akal Takhat. They destroyed the sanctity of the Sri Akal Takhat with tanks and reduced it to rubble, while attempting to take out Baba Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his men in a controversial military operation known as Operation Bluestar.

The Akal Takhat is the most supreme of all the Takhats. There are four other Takhats established by the panth (community) during the last century:</i></p>
